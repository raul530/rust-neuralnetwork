# rust-neuralnetwork
 
 The goal of this project was to understand neural networks better.

 Since I'm just learning how to use Rust, the idea was just coding together with
 a video, and at the end of the video trying to understand this code.

 Well, currently, I don't understand nothing, but that's the main goal. 
 Starting with something that I don't understand, deep study so I can came back
 on this project one day and say: "Now I understand"

 Maybe LLMs can help me to understand? Back to coding!
